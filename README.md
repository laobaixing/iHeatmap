Help researchers to build a heatmap through an interactive way. 

Now use python to provide a GUI for a public R package heatmap3.

Before use this program,  
For Linux and MAC system, Users need to:   
1) Install heatmap3 package from CRAN.  
2) Install rpy2. 

For windows system, users need to;
1) Install heatmap3 package from CRAN.  
2) Download and Install Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition from go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7729279, if you don't have C++ compiler.  
3) Go to pywin32 sourceforge.net and select the most recent build. http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/  
4) There is no official rpy2, users need to install unofficial rpy2 module from this link: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#rpy2.

So, it is more convenience for linux user as current stage.
